# Exercise - Stock Market

A stretch activity from LHL (W01D5)

In this exercise we create a function, which, given a list of stock prices, return the maximum profit that could be made. If no profit was made then it will return -1.

Once run, the function should return either the max-profit or -1.

## Usage

example:

```
maxProfit([45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11])


16
```
